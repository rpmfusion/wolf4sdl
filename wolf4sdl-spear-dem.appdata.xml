     Maybe it was the fact that people got to blow away Nazis. Maybe it was
     the sheer challenge of it all. For whatever reason Spear of Destiny
     pioneered the first-person shooter genre and brought its legendary
     creators, id Software, worldwide notoriety and numerous awards. In fact,
     The Computer Gaming World Hall of Fame recognized Wolfenstein 3D as
     helping to shape the overall direction of the computer gaming industry.

     Wolf4SDL is an open-source port of id Software's classic first-person
     shooter Wolfenstein 3D to the cross-platform multimedia library
     "Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL)". It is meant to keep the original feel
     while taking advantage of some improvements.

     This package contains wolf4sdl compiled for playing the Spear of Destiny
     demo, as well as the Spear of Destiny demo data files.
